# Developer Info

## Suggested Pre-Event Timeline

> Be sure to attend the Volunteer Bootcamp and Kickoff Sessions.

- T-2 weeks – Lead developer, UX, BA, and Tech Jedi shall meet virtually to review requirements, scope and potential technologies to finalization on technology choice and agreement of attainable scope. This gives them a chance to ask questions and guide the PM on how to best support you during the actual weekend.

- T-1 week – All team members required. Call to review scope, technology, and ask for individual ownership of tasks. PM should set up tracking & communication tools, if applicable. Lead Dev and PM should coordinate set up of production environments with Tech Jedi.  Identify your skills needed and start reviewing technology to be used. If you are missing something, ask your PM or Tech Jedi for help.  Most importantly, detail what needs to be accomplished in a User Story format to drive to clarity of goal and expectation. 

- T-1 day – Team touch base to ensure everybody is ready for Friday night. Communicate any last-minute updates from the charity. 

## Getting Yourself Ready

The first step to starting a successful GiveCamp weekend is getting yourself prepared. It is a valuable service you are providing, and it falls on you to make sure all the donated time and resources are used in the most efficient way possible, in the limited time you have access to them.

It is hard work you can accomplish and can be very rewarding.

Start by getting yourself prepared. The charities have already done a lot of work getting their submissions ready. The GiveCamp staff has spent a lot of time and effort refining the tools and resources we must make you successful.  Spend time reviewing all artifacts BEFORE reaching out with questions or concerns to save time and effort. 

> STOP: Before reading any further, get your **Charities Long Form Application** out and review it.

As you read, pay careful attention to what is to be accomplished, and what is being asked for. This will form the basis for your planning and help ensure you can deliver exactly what the charity needs, so they can do more for the community.

### Tips on preparing for GiveCamp
- Review your Charity’s information be familiar with their mission, and what they are expecting to get at the end of GiveCamp.
- Review your Charities long form, and be familiar with their mission, and what they are specifically expecting to get at the end of GiveCamp. NOTE:  Be aware that as the PM and team work with the charity requirements might change from what was originally requested in the long form application
- Help your PM get all tasks laid out, as much as you can get set up do beforehand. If you don’t, you could waste a day on it. Your PM should start planning 4 weeks prior to event.  Key is to plan; the pace is fast.
- Identify what features/user stories/behaviors are being requested. Try to ensure that clearly defined user roles and acceptance criteria/requirements are defined. Consider reviewing or creating “cheap” mockups to better communicate the need/want and potential implementation.
- If you are new to the technology you are being asked to use, research online as much as you can beforehand, and try to find someone at GiveCamp that has experience. 
- Do a dry run of as much stuff as possible beforehand.  If you are using a database, get the database up and running early.   If you are using a third-party product, like WordPress, make sure you have all the required install media and any plug-ins or patches, etc.  Consider free trials to learning sites like PluralSight to get up to speed. 
- Try to honestly identify what you can accomplish from the list of prioritized needs that fit your skill set, so the PM can better estimate and communicate what most likely will be accomplished.
- Identify potential technology needs. Identify dependencies and try to resolve them. Know where source control may be, locations/URLs of artifacts, logins, etc. If possible, test out your tools or processes. 
- Try to login to any systems needed before GiveCamp to ensure access.
- Pull anything needed local beforehand so that bandwidth is not an issue during GiveCamp.
- Get to know your team and make sure the team knows you. Understanding everyone’s personality, communication protocols, and experience will help you work together in a small area under high pressure. Consider how your actions or words may affect others beforehand. For example, turning music up and talking on speaker phone may drive your teammates crazy. Try to keep your area clean as well. Leaving trash around can build up and become a drag. Be a leader and support your teammates.
- Understand what roles each team mate is fulfilling for the project. Your team’s PM will be one of the most important.
- Identify and communicate your travel time to your team. Share phone numbers with teammates in case an emergency occurs and GiveCamp is closer to you than another support. Try not to drive on little sleep or car pool if possible. Let your team know if you will be out during GiveCamp and for how long in order for the team to plan.
- If you have concerns about the scope, or design- communicate concerns to your team to get those resolved before the weekend.
- Work as a TEAM!!

## Working with the Charity 

You want a chance to be a hero in real life. 

Well this is it.

You are about to achieve something your charity can only dream of. They may make amazing things happen in your community and do things with their life that you would never be able to make the sacrifice to do. You are going to be performing a potentially course altering project that will impact the trajectory of their story from this point forward. That is awesome.

To work with them effectively there are two things you will need to focus on.
1. **The Relationship**. Don’t sell this short. Make sure you get to know them and their mission. They are passionate about it, and you should make sure you develop some real passion about it as well. Someone you know may come to depend upon their services soon. Take time with them and make sure you understand what they need and want.
1. **The Scope**. This is always the biggest challenge. Keeping the scope manageable and communicating that clearly. They won’t know what is possible, and what they see as valuable often will not have a direct correlation to what is hard or easy. They may get a lot of value out of a simple change and may only get a small bump from something that is very hard to do. But remember this: **Disappointment isn’t possible without first having incorrect expectations**. Whatever scope you commit to delivering, make sure your charity has the correct expectations all the way along. Don’t over commit, we only have 1 weekend.

### Work with your assigned Project manager:
- Meet with Project Manager prior to GiveCamp: gather requirements and have a clear understanding of the plan prior to GiveCamp weekend.  Define as much website content as possible.
- Work with the PMs to identify the scope you know you can deliver.  Make sure the focus is on the "must have" before the "optional" items are addressed. 
- Know when and how long they will be onsite during the weekend.
- Utilize the PM assigned to your project to communicate to the charity rep in case you have an urgent need for information or clarification.
- If possible, attend team meetings prior to GiveCamp.  The PMs will schedule.  Let them know your availability.

## Working with your Team
Your time donation and being away from friends and family to complete strangers for a good cause is more than awesome. You are greatly appreciated 
1. Manage the tasks assigned to you.  If you have a dependency on a task being worked on by another team member, communicate your timeline. Make sure you have a clear understanding of what is being delivered and the technology being used. The timeline for GiveCamp is very compressed, and if you are pulling late nights’ energy can wane and emotions flare up. 
1. Your PM can clear up questions and clear roadblocks. Invariably there will be questions, debates, and issues with technology. Be sure to rely on your PM for this, so you can remain heads down on your work and having enough time is critical. 
   
## Working the Weekend
Showtime. The GiveCamp weekend is where all your hard work and preparation will pay off. It will seem crazy at times, and when you explain it to people they may not get it. But it will be a memorable weekend and if done right will move the world towards being a better place. Some important things to keep in mind:
**The schedule**. That is really it. Make sure you are on target, and if you are not, let somebody know right away. You must make things happen fast if anything starts trending the wrong way.
- Be ready to hit the ground running, build databases, install WordPress, and make sure IIS is working. 
- Know when food is going to be served and plan out tasks and breaks accordingly.
- Have regularly planned status updates, this will vary by team, but if you sense a lull, have a team huddle.
- Start deploying code as soon as possible.
- Test and deliver as you go, work with your team on how that will work.
- Try to have all the code done before the end of Saturday.
- Use Sunday for fighting bugs, moving content, tweaking the UI, training the charity, and getting the summary deck ready.  

> But above all **STAY ON SCHEDULE**.

### Outline of developer responsibilities at GiveCamp
- **Do what is best for the charity** 
- Ensuring the charity has a site they can maintain and keep running are key
- Due to time constraints a minimal viable product is appropriate with technology at hand 
- Reuse well known, tested libraries and frameworks as much as possible
- Technology that is used during GiveCamp weekend needs to be simple enough for the charities to admin after GiveCamp weekend.  
- Keep it simple - No resume building work!
- Watch what you use - Be careful not to violate any copyrights
- Test all the tools before the weekend
- Attend pre-meetings as your schedule allows.  If you miss any, please reach out to your team lead for an update.
- Commit! - Your team and assigned charity is relying on you
- Complete your assigned tasks - Help others!

### Tech Jedi
- Each team will be assigned a Tech Jedi
- This resource has years’ worth of experience in technology and GiveCamp.  They are here to help you with technical issues, for any escalations that you, the developer, may have.  
- If your assigned Jedi is not readily available, let your organizer know.

### Manage the following during the actual weekend
- Participate in your team’s progress checks 
- Tasks- White Board, post-its, Trello; pre-defined for the most part based on prep
- Work with your PM & Charity rep when you have questions about what a requirement is asking or if your implementation meets the requirement.  
- Risk management- use something you are familiar with and comfortable with.  Track on whiteboards, or post-its
- Timeframe- Stick to a defined scope and understood what can’t be accomplished. Think Minimal viable product, then enhance.  Be on the lookout for other solutions that could implement most of the requirement but be easier to build/maintain. For example, your charity might ask for something and a WordPress plugin might already exist that most of what they are asking for. However, to give them the 100% solution you would need to write a bunch of code. The existing plugin might be a better route because it is better documented and supported longer term then custom code you would write.
- Testing- Developers and Charity rep should test as work is completed
- Communications- deliver clear expectations 
- Escalations- Reach out to GiveCamp Organizers & Tech Jedi’s as needed. Don’t waste a lot of time spinning your wheels.
- Coordination- huddle and use whiteboard
- Delivery- Don’t wait to Sunday afternoon to do one big bang push. You don’t want to find out Sunday afternoon that you are missing something and cannot deploy. 

### Common challenges and how to prepare for them
- Bandwidth- Wi-Fi gets overloaded and can't handle workload from the teams. First day- everyone syncing and loading.  At the end- also everyone is trying to copy web pages.  Plan ahead.
- Keep it simple – Remember that the charity is going to need to own this project starting Monday and you have a very limited time and resources to get the project done. Do you best to keep the developers focused on the “minimal viable product” before starting any “cool ideas” or nice to haves. 
  
### Tips and Tricks for working with your team
- Expect struggles and challenges from yourself, technology and teammates. It’s easier to deal with issues when you know they are sure to come.
- Take breaks when you need to stay focused on delivery. Try to plan your breaks if possible and know when lunch and dinner occurs. 
- Time box your work to help achieve each step toward the goal. 
- If possible, look at doing a very simple task that involves as many layers/levels to ensure the process of delivering is established. Do not try to build something large and push through. Small and simple will lay the foundation for large and complex.
- If you have a dependency on a task being worked on by another team member, communicate your timeline.
- If you are asked to track progress, understand the tool and when to update. It would better to over communicate given the short amount of time. The sooner an issue is brought to the table the sooner it can be resolved.
- Use your team’s expertise and experience if you hit a road block. Your PM can clear up questions and clear roadblocks. Invariably there will be questions, debates, and issues with technology. Be sure to rely on your PM for this, so you can remain heads down on your work and having enough time is critical. 

## Working with the Technology
Obviously, the success or failure of your weekend will depend largely on you and your team’s ability to get the technology the charity needs, acquired, deployed, configured, and populated with correct content. Many GiveCamp projects involve some level of data migration or content remastering. Rarely do they come to GiveCamp with NO website or email.

We will use a few technologies' during the weekend.  The project manager will have all needed codes for the tech leads to set up prior to the weekend.

- Prior to the weekend GiveCamp Tech Jedi can install production for any team that needs Everleap & Wordpress. We highly recommend this and your PM can request this if desired. 
- If you do receive an install code, please keep in mind this is only for charity use only.
- If your team is using Everleap please include - Everleap verbiage "Hosting donated by Everleap", with a link back to Everleap.com. 
- Please put in the site footer "Site Created by the volunteers of Dalas GiveCamp", with a link back to DallasGiveCamp.org.

### Tips and Tricks for working with technology
- Technology is much easier to deal with when you have a small, clearly defined objective. Make sure you have a plan then work your tasks. Defining user stories and acceptance criteria beforehand will help you deliver more successfully.
- Take backups if possible of any and all systems your team may change.
- Make sure you can access everything you need to. Murphy (aka Murphy’s Law) will be waiting for you especially when you are low on patience.
- Try to build and deploy, if applicable, without changes to ensure your DevOps/delivery process is in order before adding changes.
- Small chunks of work are easier to deal with than large chunks of work. Test and deploy often to ensure quality and give more time to productivity than fixing.
- Try to stay loosely coupled especially for web links or configurations that may change if the system is deployed somewhere else.
- Don’t feel like it must be perfect. You may want to have separation of concerns, but given the amount of time to deliver, you may put business rules in the UI, etc. Delivering the feature technically “dirty” may be good enough. Of course, always strive to do what is right for the charity. A working solution is valued over an awesome solution that never is finished.
 
### Lesson learned from past GiveCamps
- Use Relative URLs for links to images, documents and pages, as this will ensure that nothing is lost when the DNS transfer happens 
- Make sure Website available and domain temp-name set up. Complete DNS transfer **after** the charity has approved the new website. Be VERY careful when making DNS changes as they could impact other services registered to the charities domain, like email. When in doubt ask for assistance from the Tech Jedis if you have any questions.
- Group requirements by the section (page) of the website that they belong on, this will make it easier to divide the work between the team members. Notify event staff if you feel your team is understaffed
- Upfront training is available on the technology being used.  

## Tech Details

Most of the charities need help with Content Management Systems (aka website they can manage without being a developer) to provide online information to the world about them. Some charities are moving to CRM, and fewer have deeper custom development or other needs. Remember to make sure; if possible, you back up existing work before making changes.

- **Content Management System (CMS)** – Most charities requirements are for a basic brochure type website (home, about us, contact us, etc.). Additionally, one of our main goals of GiveCamp is to leave the charity with something they can maintain without the help of a developer. To that end in many cases we want to implement a CMS for them. There are many CMS’s available; however, we strongly recommend using WordPress, unless the charity has a specific reason not to. We recommend this because WordPress has thousands of plugins, themes, etc. available that will greatly speed your development time. WordPress also provides an easy to use web interface so that the charity can maintain the site on an ongoing basis. 
    - WordPress is very easy to use. If you have a plan and clear goal, implementation should be much easier.
    - WordPress will demand an admin type user to be able to update themes, add plugins, set configurations, etc. The WordPress website has editing tools built into the browser, so other development tools are not necessary. Deployments can be as simple as clicking a button to change the content online without a deployment process.
    - There are many plugins for WordPress that most likely cover the same pattern of need by your charity. You may need to review the features needed and make a list of plugins available with tradeoffs to review with the team, PM, and/or charity.
    - Depending on your theme choice, and the content you put in it, WordPress can produce a very nice mobile ready website as well as a website that works well on a full browser
    - Consider documenting how certain patterns are implemented as a way to empower the charity to take ownership and change their own content after GiveCamp.  For Example: how do they modify the content on a page, add a blog post, add a new event.
- **Custom Dev** – This is a wide range and deep subject. There may be a developer environment setup script, or all tools may be provided on a virtual machine. Custom development may be in .Net or Java, in or out of the cloud, with or without a database, and may or may not include automated support like unit testing. Most likely source control systems are used as well as a build and deploy process. This area demands experienced individuals with a well-defined process and is typically not something that the charity can maintain after the GiveCamp Weekend is over.
- **Security Recommendations**
  - Only use strong passwords for your site, consider using a password manager or a passphrase (Williehorsesbatterycamp versus Welc0me!)
  - Developers please enable CAPTCHA on DIVI contact us form
  - We strongly recommend using pre-configured GiveCamp WordPress & DIVI versions and keep them up-to-date in the future.
  - Don't allow your users of your site to upload files to your site or carefully consider it beforehand since hackers could exploit the privilege and upload malware. 
  - Only give admin/editor access to those you know and trust.
  - Backup your site regularly
    - Dallas GiveCamp has an automated Backup Process for charities using Everleap & WordPress. Confirm with your PM that this has been setup. 
    - If backing up yourself backup your backups to ensure you're not going to be left if your primary backup fails
  - We recommend you use WordPress plugins that are 
    - Popular and frequently updated
    - Compatible with your WordPress version, 
    - Well rated, please read reviews of the plugin before using
  - Ensure the computer you use to administer your WordPress site is frequently updated and has an updated anti-virus software installed 
  - We recommend scanning your site with the Sucuri scanner (https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/) 
- **Team Communication** – A common automated communication tool like Slack will be used. It is a great way to communicate and document issues allowing you to move on to other things.
  - **What is Slack**

    Slack, is a team messaging app that uses channels. It’s chat room for your team. At GiveCamp each team will be given a channel prior to the event so that they can communicate. Prior to the event it is great to reduce the amount of email you get and during the event it is very helpful to share links, files, etc. between members of the team. 

  - Get the App

    Download Slack apps for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac [https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads).

## When it’s over

Your PM will be putting together a presentation of your team’s work. **NOTE: Do take before and after photos and screenshots (if applicable) of your work (i.e. site updates, etc.…).** Consider asking along the way if something you have or have delivered may be worth adding to the presentation. Your Monday after GiveCamp could be a drastic change. Consider trying to schedule downtime Sunday night to easy back into the real world.
