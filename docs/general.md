# General Event Info

## The Most Important thing to remember

If you take nothing else away from this document, remember this:

**GiveCamp Rule #1:**

> GiveCamp is a REALLY SHORT weekend! The more you can plan and prepare, the better the weekend will go. Be patient and over communicate before implementing to better define what will be accomplished.

All the following advice will be specific examples of that rule in action. 

## General GiveCamp Info

This is a living document bookmark this page and check for updates at [https://handbook.dallasgivecamp.org](http://handbook.dallasgivecamp.org). Email questions to [contact@dallasgivecamp.org](mailto:contact@dallasgivecamp.org)

Volunteers will be assigned to a charity prior to GiveCamp weekend. This will be communicated out by one of the GiveCamp leads. 

> Volunteers are NOT allowed to solicit the charities for additional PAID work. Volunteers may continue to volunteer with a charity they are passionate about, however the expectation is that the work will be completed during the weekend, so volunteers will not have any obligations past the end of the GiveCamp event. 

### Key Dates:

#### Event Kickoff

## Helpful Tools

### Slack
Slack is a team messaging app that uses channels. It’s chat room for your team. At GiveCamp each team will be given a channel prior to the event so that they can communicate. Prior to the event it is great to reduce the amount of email you get and during the event it is very helpful to share links, files, etc. between members of the team. 

- [Download](https://slack.com/downloads) the Slack app for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac.

#### Slack Tips

##### First time login

When you sign in to Slack for the first time, basically every type of notification imaginable is enabled. 

The service offers several different ways to manage notifications. Each channel has individual notification preferences, so you can get notifications for every message, just your name being mentioned or nothing at all.

To get to the settings, open the channel you want to change and click the name of it at the top of the screen, then "channel notification preferences."

From here you can set up both mobile and desktop notifications, so the alerts only go where you want them.

##### Search

Everything that’s posted, by integrations or humans is indexed by Slack for quick retrieval later.

As you start typing in the search box, Slack suggests things you might like to search for, like a specific person or messages from people in a channel.

You can use a number of special words as ‘operators’ to narrow down your search. For example, searching for "after: yesterday" will find all messages sent today.

##### Joining a channel

You will need to join the channel for your charity, techninja, general, etc.

[Instructions here](https://www.wikihow.com/Join-a-Channel-on-Slack)

##### Slack commands you need to know

**@channel**

A channel in Slack is like a "room" for discussions, usually arranged around a topic of discussion or the relevant team. To send a notification to everyone in the channel, type @channel and then your message.

This can be annoying if you’re in a large channel, particularly if there are people across a lot of time zones. People tend to use @channel a lot, but it’s useful for getting everyone’s attention.

**@username**

To send a notification to a specific person inside a channel, type @username. For example, to alert me, you’d type @owen.

**@here**

Like @channel but only notifies people that are online and active, so less annoying.

**/me**

If you want to talk in third person, this is for you. For example, if you’re going to lunch, you’d type "/me is going to lunch" and it would show as "Owen is going to lunch."

**DM**

Direct/private message between you and one other person.

**Private Group**

Like a channel, but by invitation only. Useful as a ‘disposable’ room for events, quick team discussions or gossip.
