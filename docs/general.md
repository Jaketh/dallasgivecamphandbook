# General Event Info

## The Most Important thing to remember

If you take nothing else away from this document, remember this:

**GiveCamp Rule #1:**

> GiveCamp is a REALLY SHORT weekend! The more you can plan and prepare, the better the weekend will go. Be patient and over communicate before implementing to better define what will be accomplished.

All the following advice will be specific examples of that rule in action. 

## General GiveCamp Info
