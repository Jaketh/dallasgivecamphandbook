# Wordpress Plugins

## WordPress Plugin Marketplace
WordPress has over 50,000 Plugins. Some are free, some are not. Some are good, some are not. Most will provide more features, that are better tested and maintained then writing your own code.

# Choosing the right Plugin
With so many plugins to choose from, it might be hard to find the right one. We recommend using review from trusted sources, like the Elegent Themes Blog to narrow down the list. It is also good to test them on your local instance of WordPress, to make sure that they will play nice with your site and do what you want.
