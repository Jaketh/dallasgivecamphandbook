# Charity Info

## Email

Many of the non-profits that we work with ask us about email hosting using the domain name of the charity. So, you can have an email like `yourname@yournonprofit.org`.  We typically recommend using a major email service provider like Microsoft or Google and not a smaller hosting company as there services tend to be more robust and come with other benefits. The good news is that both companies offer free programs for nonprofits. These programs can also include other free services like cloud storage, productivity tools, and other Cloud Services.

> NOTE: It can take some time for your non-profit to be approved.
